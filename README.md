# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Portfolio site 2.0 using Bootstrap

## Description
This is the third challenge in my bootcamp on front-end web development. The challenge was to create the same website from the 2nd challenge in bootstrap. 

The instructions were as follows:

1.Create a new GitHub repositories and name it Bootstrap-Portfolio.

2.Clone this repository to your computer.

3.Inside your Bootstrap-Portfolio repo, create the folder structure for the webpage.

    -Create a folder structure.
        -Create a index.html.
        -Create a css folder.
           -Inside create a style.css file.
        -Create an images folder.
           -Place all your images in this folder.

4.Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:

The website should include the following bootstrap components:

    -A Navigation bar
    -A navigation menu at the top. Feel free to use bootstrap's navbar or create your own.
        -Include links that are applicable to your portfolio.
            -Links should navigate to the appropriate sections
    -A hero section
        -A jumbotron featuring your picture, your name, and any other information you'd like to include.
    -A work section
        -A section displaying your work in grid.
            -If you need to use placeholder image use: https://placehold.co/
        -Use bootstrap cards for each project.
            -The description should give a brief overview of the work.
        -Each project will eventually link to your class project work!
    -A skills section
        -List out the skills you expect to learn from the bootcamp.
    -An about / contact section.
        -An "About Me" section in the same row.
    -A footer section.
        -All hyperlinks should have a hover effect.
        -All buttons should display a box shadow upon hover.
